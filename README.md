# YouTube Trending Video Analysis (India, UK, US)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube trending video data across India, UK, and US to identify patterns in engagement, visibility, category performance, and cross-country dominance.

The analysis was conducted using Python (Pandas) for preprocessing and Power BI for dashboard visualization.


## Objectives

- Compare median engagement rates across countries
- Identify categories with highest visibility (median views)
- Analyze engagement intensity by category
- Examine publishing time and monthly trends
- Study impact of trending duration on engagement
- Investigate cross-country trending behavior


## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Google Colab
- Power BI
- GitHub


##  Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates at video level
   - Engineered features:
     - `engagement_rate`
     - `publish_hour`
     - `trending_month`
     - `trend_days`
     - `country_count`

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Median engagement by country
   - Median views by country
   - Category-level comparison
   - Cross-country trending distribution
   - Engagement vs trending duration analysis

3. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
   - KPI cards (Median Engagement, Median Views, Avg Trend Days)
   - Country comparison charts
   - Category insights page
   - Cross-country dominance analysis


##  Key Insights

- US and UK show significantly higher median engagement compared to India.
- Some categories drive high visibility (views) but not necessarily high engagement.
- Videos trending in multiple countries tend to have stronger engagement rates.
- Engagement generally increases with longer trending duration.
- Peak visibility appears during mid-year months.



##  Deliverables

- Cleaned video-level dataset
- Analytical notebook (Colab)
- Power BI dashboard
- 1–2 page project report
- GitHub repository documentation



##  Skills Demonstrated

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Statistical comparison using medians
- Cross-country behavioral analysis
- Dashboard storytelling
- Insight-driven reporting


##  Conclusion

This project highlights how visibility and engagement differ across countries and categories, and demonstrates the importance of analyzing median-based metrics to avoid distortion from outliers.
